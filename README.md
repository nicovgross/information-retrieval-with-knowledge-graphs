## Information Retrieval with Knowledge Graphs

This project evaluates the impact of Knowledge Graph-based query expansion on document retrieval quality using BM25 as a basis for comparison.

### Techniques
- Information Retrieval (BM25)
- Knowledge Graphs
- Named Entity Recognition (spaCy)
- Entity linking
- Query Expansion
- Evaluation metrics: precision, recall, MAP, NDCG

### Files
- Notebook: implementation and experiments
- Report (EN/PT): full theoretical background and results

### Results
Knowledge Graph-based query expansion improved precision and recall depending on entity linking quality and expansion strategy. For more details, read the report.
